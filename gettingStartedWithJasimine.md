# Testing with Jasimine

Agenda:

- understand what Jasmine and unit testing are
- define a "unit test" and its value
- define `describe`, `it` and matchers and spies
- write better tests with `before` and `after` hooks

## The value of testing

Automated testing is one of the most valuable skills any developer or software engineer can have because:

- automated testing quickly validates core requirements of an application
- automated testing can ensure that code runs the way we expect it to, and makes it apparent when it is not
- automated testing is far faster and more efficient than manual testing 
- automated testing provideds rapid feedback 

As applications grow, testing can ensure that new features do not break existing features and functionality
